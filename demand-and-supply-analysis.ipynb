It is a fundamental tool in understanding how prices are determined in a market economy.\n\n- The Law of Demand states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a product or service increases, the quantity demanded by consumers decreases, and vice versa. This relationship is represented by a downward-sloping demand curve. The demand curve shows the various quantities of a product that consumers are willing and able to buy at different price levels.\n\n- The Law of Supply, on the other hand, states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a product or service increases, the quantity supplied by producers increases, and vice versa. This relationship is represented by an upward-sloping supply curve. The supply curve shows the various quantities of a product that producers are willing and able to supply at different price levels.\n\n- The interaction of demand and supply in a market determines the equilibrium price and quantity. The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. It represents the market-clearing price, where there is no excess supply or demand. The equilibrium quantity is the quantity of a product that will be bought and sold at the equilibrium price.\n\n- Changes in demand or supply can lead to shifts in the demand or supply curves, resulting in changes in the equilibrium price and quantity. Various factors can influence demand and supply, including changes in consumer preferences, income levels, population, technology, input prices, government policies, and external events.\n\n- When demand increases or supply decreases, the equilibrium price and quantity both tend to rise. Conversely, when demand decreases or supply increases, the equilibrium price and quantity both tend to fall.\n\n- Demand and supply analysis provides valuable insights into market dynamics, price determination, and the allocation of resources. It helps businesses make production and pricing decisions, policymakers design effective policies, and economists understand market behavior.\n\n- The demand for a product or service is the quantity of that product or service the customers are willing to purchase at any given price during a particular period. And the supply for a product or service is the quantity the producers are willing to provide in the market at a particular price and a particular period.\n\n- Demand and Supply analysis means analyzing the relationship between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. It helps businesses understand the factors influencing consumer demand to maximize profits.\n\n- For the task of Demand and Supply analysis, we need a dataset based on demand for a product or service and supply for a product or service. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which is based on the demand for cab rides at a given time and the availability of drivers at a given time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.io as pio\npio.templates.default = \"plotly_white\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-17T12:01:36.080354Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-17T12:01:36.080703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.233281Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-17T12:01:36.08067Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.232159Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/demand-and-supply-dataset/rides.csv')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.235013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.235345Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.261552Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.23532Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.260184Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.263424Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.263771Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.286418Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.263744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.285213Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# null values or not","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.isnull().sum())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.288293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.288622Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.299867Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.2886Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-17T12:01:38.298629Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- The dataset has 54 null values in the Rides Completed column.
